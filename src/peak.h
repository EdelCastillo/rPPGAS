//Determines the existing peak in an array of magnitudes whose values must be in the range [0:1].

//is variable within a given range and is directly associated with the value of the magnitude.

    //arguments:
    //magnitude_p[] -> array of input values to extract peak (positive reals)

    //4 states: UP, DOWN, T_UP and T_DOWN
    //UP status
    //remains when positive increments greater than or equal to m_peakGap occur.
    //if positive increments less than m_peakGap occur, it goes to the T_UP state.
    //if negative increments greater than m_peakGap occur, it is passed to T_DOWN (peak).
    //DOWN status
    //remains when negative increments greater than or equal to m_peakGap occur.
    //if negative increments less than m_peakGap occur, the state goes to T_DOWN.
    //if positive increments greater than m_peakGap occur, it is passed to the UP (valley).
    //T_UP status.
    //remains when absolute increments occur with respect to the start less than or equal to m_peakGap.
    //If these increments are positive and exceed m_peakGap, it goes to the UP state.
    //If these increments are negative and exceed m_peakGap, it goes to the DOWN state (peak at maximum value within the state).
    //T_DOWN state.
    //remains when absolute increments occur with respect to the start less than or equal to m_peakGap.
    //If these increments are positive and exceed m_peakGap, it goes to the UP state (valley at minimum value within the state).
    //If these increments are negative and exceed m_peakGap, it goes to the DOWN state.

    //Grades:
    //when leaving the T-UP or TDOWN states, the last two elements must be reevaluated in the next state.
    //The FSM is entered through the UP or DOWN states.
    //When reaching the last element, special consideration is made about the state it is in to complete the last ion.
    //Those elements with a value less than m_noise are canceled before analyzing them.
    //Arguments
    //mzIndexIni -> low index to the magnitude_p[] array. First element to evaluate.
    //mzIndexEnd -> high index to the magnitude_p[] array. Last element to evaluate.
